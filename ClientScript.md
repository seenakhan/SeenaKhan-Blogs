Hello all Power enthusiasts, welcome to my another blog. The purpose of this blog is to go over how to implement standard user experience automation methods using Client Script API. You should use this particular client scripting API to implement your data interaction, form content changes, or app behavior updates. While writing your logic in JavaScript, keep in mind that, even if the form is built with standard HTML, direct manipulation of the form content is not supported. Client scripting creates an object model and methods for interacting with the various form components. This method assures that any changes to the layout or specific HTML used in form rendering do not disrupt your business logic. 

## Objectives:-
### Tasks
1. Prepare solution with the form
2. Build the client script.
3. Upload the script.
4. Edit form.
5. Test.

### Prerequisites:-
* Access to Power Platform with Premium connection.
* Access to Power platform environment with sample apps enabled
* Basic understanding of Microsoft Power Platform and experience in 
  software development against the Microsoft stack and Visual Studio 
  code.
* Experience in administering solutions in Microsoft Azure is preferred.
